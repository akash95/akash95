I am a current Master of Science in Business Analytics student with 3.5 years of experience as an analytics professional having worked on topics such as pricing and market access, product portfolio prioritization, and revenue forecasting. As part of my practicum coursework at UC Davis, I am currently engaging with the CEO of an AI-powered clothing retailer to build a robust recommendation system and a demand forecasting model for inventory prediction. Additionally, I am well versed with using Python, R, SQL, MongoDB and Tableau. I am looking to use my past work experience along with the skillset I have developed as part of the master’s degree to solve interesting business problems in the industry.

<h2>Ongoing Projects/Courses at UC Davis MSBA</h2>

- 🌱 I’m currently learning - Big Data Analytics and Supply Chain as part of my MSBA Course.
- 🔭 As part of my final project in Big Data Analytics course at UC Davis MSBA, I’m working on creating a machine learning model that can accurately diagnose medical diseases based on diagnostic data. The aim of this project is to look for ways to make the diagnosis of diseases easier and hence lead to an early diagnosis.
- ⚡ One of the interesting case studies I did recently as part of Supply chain coursework was the Harvard Case Study - KYY where we basically look at storage asssignment in a Unit load warehouse. I am also currently learning Inventory Optimization, Task Allocation, Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), Supply Chain Contract, and Multi-commodity Flow Network as part of this course


<h2>Past projects:</h2>

- :moneybag: Marketing Mix Effectiveness Analysis: Evaluated impact of advertising activities on the sales of a four-year-old cosmetic product and reported on effectiveness of advertising spends and created a regression model in R to guide future advertising investments
- :dollar: Investment Analysis: Conducted risk analytics on investment recommendations for an asset management company, and leveraged SQL and Python to perform A/B testing and Chi-square test
- 🎁 Amazon gift card analysis:	Web scraped eBay search results for Amazon gift cards sold above face value, and determined the fraction of such cards
- :artist: Bored APE (NFT): Using selenium to scrape the top-8 most expensive Bored Apes (NFTs) within a specific category, and then storing each ape along with its attributes in a MongoDB collection 
- :credit_card: Predicting the credit card fraud transaction based on multiple machine learning algorithms like Neural network, XGBoost, Random Forest, Decision Tree as well Logistic Regression and then comparing their performance on the test dataset
